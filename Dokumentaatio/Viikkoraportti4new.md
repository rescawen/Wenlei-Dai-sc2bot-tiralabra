## Week report 3

### What have I done this week?

### How has the project progressed?

### What did I learn this week?

### What problems did I encounter this week?

### What will I do next?

I would like to start by apologizing for all the troubles this project has caused so far and potentially some problems it will cause in the peer review because one has to follow instructions pretty strictly to get it to work on your own computer.

I think I finished the competition at [rank 20](https://artificial-overmind.reaktor.com/team/e2be9c2f-396d-4946-b9ac-818c4e76f7f0/dashboard) and I would like to go into off topic to explain what went on the last week. 

Right now with my operating systems course the main exam only happens later in April. So during the period of the course, the only way to pass the course is to do well in the miniexams which started last week on basically the same day as the programming competition ended. Chinese New Year which took place at beginning of that week which further complicated my schedule. The full schedule for actually competing in Sc2 esports has been released during the past week. It would seem to indicate that some of the most important tournaments might take place during April. This created a dilemma where I ultimatedly decided to sacrifice this programming competition for the making my life easier for when the playing competitions take place.
