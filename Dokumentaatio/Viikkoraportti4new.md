## Week report 3

### What have I done this week?

### How has the project progressed?

### What did I learn this week?

### What problems did I encounter this week?

### What will I do next?

I would like to start by apologizing for all the troubles this project has caused so far and potentially some problems it will cause in the peer review because one has to follow instructions pretty strictly to get it to work on your own computer.

I think I finished the competition at [rank 20](https://artificial-overmind.reaktor.com/team/e2be9c2f-396d-4946-b9ac-818c4e76f7f0/dashboard) and I would like to go off topic to explain what went on the last week. 

Right now with my operating systems course the main exam only happens later in April. So during the period of the course, the only way to pass the course is to do well in the miniexams which started last week on basically the same day as the programming competition ended. Chinese New Year which took place at beginning of that week which further complicated my schedule. The full schedule for actually competing in Sc2 esports has been released during the past week. It would seem to indicate that some of the most important tournaments might take place during April. This created a dilemma where I ultimatedly decided to sacrifice this programming competition for the making my life easier for when the playing competitions take place. 

Thinking from a operating systems perspective, it is very ironic where sometimes individual or system needs to sacrifice current performance to ensure that future performance will not crash. In other words it is wise to distribute workload evenly over time.

Coming back to the logistics of this project. This week I was finishing up adding some functionalities and will be dividing the code up for a more clear structure to read and interpret. For the future I want to try and implement a queue. It is more specifically a spending queue. In the game of starcraft you constantly mine 2 types of resources. One wants to spend these resources as fast as possible. At the same time you need to decide where to invest them. This spending queue will allow are a more dynamic way to decide how to spend the resources. 

I will now give up the deep learning ambitions and focus purely on a logic based system based around this idea of spending queue. This should align closer to the idea of this course. I have not forgotten about the the area of testing and will be focussing on that as well. To summarize I want to take a step back from just getting the bot to win and focus on good programming concepts. This will be a good foundation for the next time this competition takes place. Many people started to voice the necessicity of refactoring their code at the end of the competition. 

P.S I want to clarify that this spending queue idea is not mine. A handful of people during this competition have helped on numerous different things.
