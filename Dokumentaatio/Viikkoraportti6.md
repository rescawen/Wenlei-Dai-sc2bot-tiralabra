## Week report 6

### What have I done this week?

### How has the project progressed?

### What did I learn this week?

### What problems did I encounter this week?

### What will I do next?

This week is similarly disappointing to last week. There are only a few more days of OS course left and then I can fully focus on finishing this project. 

Testing is still not started and basic implementation of queue has started. Unfortunately the queue will be a relatively simple data structure but using it in the program will be somewhat complicated. It might also be the only data structure that I will be using. 

Code review was in Go and ended up being more about integration problems. It took a long time to get things working on my own computer. 

Nothing else to add except I hope I can pass this course, because I need to start OhtuProjekti as soon as possible. Thanks for the opportunity to do this, because it has been a great experience.
