# Design document

In Starcraft2 there are distinct 3 races. The race that I play with is Zerg and that will be where I focus on my efforts. There are a total of 6
unique matchups in the game, but from a subjective perspective one only needs to worry about 3 match ups. 

Starcraft2 offers a wide variety of maps, but the focus for this bot is to use standard competitive 1v1 maps. 

I will be using the follow guide made my sentdex [python sc2 tutorial](https://pythonprogramming.net/starcraft-ii-ai-python-sc2-tutorial/) 
as an anchor and direction of my focus. 

One can approach this project from a computer science or game objective perspective. One can create something that is very complex in terms of
code but isn't very winning. One can go in the opposite direction of creating as simple as possible bot with least amount of lines of code
to achieve a relatively high winrate. 

The goal of this project is to find a middleground. Where the winning capability and learning process of this course are taken into account.
