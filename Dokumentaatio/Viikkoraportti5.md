## Week report 5

### What will I do next?

This has been one of the busiest weeks so far. Right now my operating systems last miniexam ends on the 27.2 and this course final deadline is on 8th of March. Due to this schedule it is logical to prioritize on getting through OS course for now. There will not be a OS course examination which is why the miniexams are extra important. 

I finalized some refactoring but still have not gotten around to starting all the tests and data structure stuff. Apart from my own project I did my first code review ever for ChessAI. 

This week is overall quite lackluster, so I hope to pick up the pace again next week.
