## Week report 3

### What have I done this week?

### How has the project progressed?

### What did I learn this week?

### What problems did I encounter this week?

### What will I do next?

Once again I have been adding functionality into my code. The bot is much more versatile now capable of playing a transitional game. 
I will be uploading my bot to the ladder where it will face stronger enemies then the provided default ones, on 2.2 saturday. This is the equivalent of pushing code to production. 

The thing that standed out the most for me is how the refering to certain units that are able to morph into others work. The game state sort of deletes the old unit and creates a new one from programming point of view. So for example if I have a variable refering to the unit that has not yet gone into metamorphisis, the game will crash once the metamorphisis is complete because of nullpointer type of error.

Next we are entering the final few days of competition to select the top 5 candidates for the offline finals. This is why I am leaving my report this week relatively short. I hope a good result will say a lot more than any amount of words!
