## Week report 4

### What have I done this week?

### How has the project progressed?

### What did I learn this week?

### What problems did I encounter this week?

### What will I do next?

This is has been a disappointing week in my progression and learning. I want to keep the reasons private and will communicate through other channels. 

Basically there are 2 big libraries to create bots python-sc2 and pysc2. Both of these are written in python, but the actual game client is in c++. The idea of automizing games played and peeking into the replays cannot be done easily with python. The aspects of dealing with the replay saving features are not easily doable with python-sc2. 

At this point the best way is to just manually move replays from the folder that they saved to the local one. I can also manually rename the replay name, so that it already gives some informative information on how long it took and whether I won or not. 

Of course theoretically I haven't abandoned the idea of creating automatic testing on a post game level/replay level of analysis. 

In the material the deep learning way of doing things will save data in terms whether decision making this game was useful as source for next games decisions. I am not sure if this can be used to do some kind of testing as of yet. 

Other than I have basically been progressing through deep learning part of the material. It has been interesting going from implementing relatively vanilla algorithms in introduction to AI to something very specific. We didn't actually implement any algorithms in intro to AI that I am using for this situation now. To be perfectly honest I do not even understand that part of the code very well yet. Nevertheless this game that I do understand extremely well, I can understand the basics of deep learning better. 


Next I will focus on the following:

1. Make the decision on whether I should completely give on automizing testing. 
2. Continue progressing through the material.
3. Implement deep learning to my own bot(s).
4. Start commenting the code.
5. Start making preparations on creating instructions on how to run this code another persons computer.
