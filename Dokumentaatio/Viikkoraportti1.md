I just want to summarize what went wrong with my last attempt. The two main pitfalls last time was inability to make replay analysis
and deep learning work. 

Replays were not saving in the correct folder and automatic naming was not possible. This causes really big problems when it comes to 
testing. Now I can generate high numbers of replays to prove at relative scale what kind of performance my bot has against another bot. 
This will be the "integration test" level approach to this project. 

Deep learning involved some unofficial libraries that simply did not work on my computer. The model that I was using from the 
[sentdex guide part 12](https://pythonprogramming.net/using-neural-network-starcraft-ii-ai-python-sc2-tutorial/) was simply failing on my
own computer. 

I need to look into unit testing in python for the bot. However there is not unified framework for unit testing so it might have to be bot
specific. 

I also need to look into what to do because right the gitlab page for artificial overmind is private and not viewable. After the competition
ends it will not matter, but before that I do not have a good solution yet.

Other than the above there isn't anything else to say. There hasn't been any problems and the project hasn't progressed much.
