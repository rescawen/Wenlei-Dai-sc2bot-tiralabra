## Week report 6

### What have I done this week?

### How has the project progressed?

### What did I learn this week?

### What problems did I encounter this week?

### What will I do next?

I have finally started to dig into the deep learning part of the material. As opposed to the rule based things prior where I could understand most things, I suddenly find myself quite lost. 

Honestly I should have skimmed through the whole course through in the beginning including the deep learning part because now I am facing the decision of how much of this can I include in my own bot. 

In terms of integration hell problems, they have kept popping up and I have needed to deal with them. Thankfully for example the OpenCV which is used to draw the state of game did not give any big problems. However major problem involving keras and tensorflow-gpu was that I could not get things working because I needed to install CUDA 9.0 and cuDNN 7.3 to allow tensorflow-gpu to work. Apparently this was some kind of prerequisitory knowledge that I should have had. 

Right I need to just keep doing as much as I can until the final deadline. I think it would wiser to at least 1 more weekly report type of text at the end, since I am not making enough progress at the moment.
