I started to get the basic environment set up for the project. It includes getting the python, pip and 
the IDE(visual studio) set up for the work on windows. The guide online was given to be straight forward, but in
reality it was not that simple. 

For example one needs to be at a specific folder in pythonXX/scripts to install the package. Then when 
things seemingly did start to work, the bot executed commands 30 seconds too late. After that I was lucky
to receive pointer to download the package directly from github master branch which then resolved all the
problems. 

There is a sc2-ai discord channel with "professional" bot makers who have been of great help to me. When I ask 
any kind of answer I get reply within less than 5 minutes.

I tried to do original code, but realized it is wiser to just follow the material to understand the basics first.
Hence my original code for the bot has not even been started as I view it to be wise to understand the api-syntax and 
learn the basics first. There are a few example bots in the repository and the 14 part sentdex guide???

The key take away that was already forshadowed in introduction to AI is that bot and human playing game is 
different in reverse scenarios. For example somethings that could take human players years to master, can be very
easily executed by a few lines of code. However some very basic intuitive things that come to human players require
a lot of logic and work around to get things running. 

There is also possibility to run game at incredibly fast speed which I did not think about. I think it is around 8 times
the normal one. This is an incredibly useful feature because you can generate the outcome of a game pretty fast and see 
if your intention in the code translates to reality very quickly. 

When one is doing simple bots, even when you have already implemented quite some code. It is still feels very "stupid" for humans, where if something is not taken into account in its strict logic constraints it will fall apart completely. 

Pylint(default python linting for VSC) is giving me errors in very random errors that I think are related specifics for 
this API and also not linting certain typos that I make. 

Right now I am still in mostly information absorbal stage and I want to try to analyse as many different bots and go through
the guide as fast as possible. When I feel like I have enough expertise I will start doing my own bot immediately as that is 
the most exciting part. I already have some theoritical ideas I want to implement, so I am feeling confident.
