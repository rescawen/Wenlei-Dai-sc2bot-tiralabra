testing priorityqueue

simplest way to see the effects of it working properly is to strip away all build orders etc 

for example only have queens zerglings and drones competing resources over each other

adjusting the priority should yield different ratio to how many of each are produced 

go through the queue and if we can make it , make it

otherwise skip
 
once we make it we remove it
