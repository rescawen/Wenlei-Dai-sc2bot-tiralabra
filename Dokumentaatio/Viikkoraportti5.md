### What will I do next?

Most disappointing week so far, pretty much didn't get anything done. Trying to focus on week 4 objectives. Realistically I want to look forward to getting a more work done on the 51th week which is the one from 17-21.12. I am still very motivated to learn about this topic and I need to be prepared for my bachelor thesis next spring.
